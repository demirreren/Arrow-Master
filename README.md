Hello!

Welcome to the Arrow Master Video Game created by Demir and Eddie, mimicking the existing Arrow Hero.

This game applies object-oriented programming, Java Swing for GUI development, multithreading, and file I/O operations.
It encompasses game logic, graphics rendering, and user interface components like score tracking!

Make sure to download all the Images and Sound files separately, without changing their names, for the code to run.

Please also download (in Raw) and watch the DEMO video to understand how the game works fully.

Enjoy!
